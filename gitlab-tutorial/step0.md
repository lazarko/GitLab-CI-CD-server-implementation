# Set up a project in GitLab

There are many ways in which you can create projects in GitLab. You can either create a blank project from scratch, import a project from Github, BitBucket, or others, or even create a project from one of many templates. 

The following sections will show how to the set up will work if you have a new blank project and if you have an existing project in Github. If you already have a project in GitLab you can skip this section and move on to ...

## Set up with a new project

In GitLab, go to Projects -> New project -> Create blank project. Choose a project name and you are all set up!

## Set up with an existing project in GitHub

In GitLab, go to Projects -> New project -> Import project. Press GitHub as the place you want to import your project from. This will redirect you GitHub where you need to agree to authorize access to gitlabhq.

All your repositories from GitHub will now be listed and you can choose which one you want to import. Importing can take a few seconds. Now you are all set up!

# Clone project

Clone your GitLab project using `git clone` with SSH or HTTPS and go into the project using `cd PROJECT_NAME`
